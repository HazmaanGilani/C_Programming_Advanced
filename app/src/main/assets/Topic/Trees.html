<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Tree:</span><br>
A tree is a non-linear data structure, that represents data in a hierarchical manner.
Every tree has a node called the root.Each node can have 1 or more nodes as children.</div><br>

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Terminology:</span><br><br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Edge:</span>The connecting link between any two nodes is called as edge. In a tree with 'n' number of nodes there are maximum of 'n-1' number of edges.<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Path:</span>The sequence of Nodes and Edges from one node to another node is called as Path between that two Nodes.<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Root:</span>A node that has no parent is called root.<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Parent Node:</span>The node which is predecessor of any node is called a Parent Node.<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Child Node:</span>The node which is descendant of any node is called a Child Node<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Siblings:</span>Nodes with comon parent are called siblings<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Leaf/External node:</span>A node that has no children is called a leaf.<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Internal Node:</span>A node with one or more children is called internal node.e.g in the fig below 81,41,96,24 are internal nodes<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Level:</span>level of any node is its distance from the root.<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Degree:</span>The degree of a node is the no of children's of that node.e.g in the fig below the degree of node 41 is 2 ,96 is 1 e.t.c<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Height:</span>The total number of edges from leaf node to a particular node in the longest path is called as Height of that Node e.g in the fig below height of the node 41 is 2 e.t.c.<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Depth:</span>The total number of edges from root node to a particular node is called as Depth of that Node e.g in the fig below depth of the node 98 is 2,50 is 2,13 is 3.<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Subtree:</span>Any part of the tree which has the properties of the tree is known as subtree of the tree.<br>
<li><span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Forest:</span>Collection of trees is called Forest.<br><br>

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Binary Tree:</span>A tree where each node can have no more than two children's is called binary tree<br><br>

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Full Binary Tree:</span>A binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two children is called a full binary tree<br><br>

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Complete Binary Tree:</span>A complete binary tree is a tree, which is completely filled, with the possible exception of the bottom level, which is filled from left to right.<br>

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Binary Search Tree:</span>A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree
such that
<li> All nodes to the left of any node have data
values less than that node
<li>All nodes to the right of any node have data
values greater than that node

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">AVL Tree:</span>
An AVL (Adelson-Velskii and Landis) tree is a binary search tree in which the height of the left and right
subtree of the root differ by at most 1 and in which the left and right subtrees
are again AVL trees. With each node of an AVL tree is associated with a
balancing factor,<br>BalanceFactor(T) of a node T=
height(T.left) - height(T.right)<br>The balancing factor of every node should be 1 or 0 or -1.
