<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Data Structure:</span><br>It is a way of organising and storing data in a computer,or In other words<br>
It is a memory representation of data<br>
<br>

<div style="padding:5px;border:2px solid #eeeeee;box-shadow:1px 1px 1px 0px grey;">
<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Primitive Data Structures:</span>They are the basic data structures that directly operate upon the machine instructions. They have different representations on different computers. e.g Integers, floating point numbers, character constants, pointers etc.
<br><br>
<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Non-primitive data structures:</span>They are derived from primitive data structures. They emphasize on grouping same or different data items with relationship between each data item.e.g Arrays, lists,Stack etc.
</div><br>

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Linear data structure:</span> A data structure is said to be linear if the
elements form a sequence i.e., while traversing sequentially, we can reach
only one element directly from another. For example : Array, Linked list,
Queue etc.<br><br>
<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Non linear data structure :</span> A data structure is said to be non-linear if the elements
do not form a sequence i.e each item or element may be connected with
two or more other items or form a hierarchical classification.For example : Trees and Graphs etc.<br></div><br>
<div style="padding:5px;border:2px solid #eeeeee;box-shadow:1px 1px 1px 0px grey;">
<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Homogenous data structure:</span> All Elements of a data structure belongs to the same data type. Ex : Array of integers contains only elements of 'int' data type, Array of characters contains only elements of 'char' data type.<br><br>
<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Non-Homogenous data structure:</span> Elements belongs to the different datatypes. Ex: Struture of student records contains elements of 'int' datatype for student_id and elements of 'char' datatype for Name and Address e.t.c

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Dynamic data structure :</span>data structure that grows or shrinks in size as per the program requirement is called dynamic data structure.Memory is allocated dynamically at run-time using Memory Allocating Functions e.g Linked list.<br><br>
<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Static data structure :</span>They have fixed size and memory has to be allocated in advance e.g Arrays</div><br>
<div style="padding:5px;border:2px solid #eeeeee;box-shadow:1px 1px 1px 0px grey;">
<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Abstract Datatype:</span><br>
The data type which does not specify an implementation is an abstract data type. It is a theoretical construct that consists of data as well as the operations to be performed on the data while hiding the implementation i.e We have only concern about data and the operations performed by the dataStrucure not how it is actually implemented.e.g a stack (which is an abstract type) can be implemented as an array, or as a linked list,but we are only concerned about the operations and the data stored by the stack.
