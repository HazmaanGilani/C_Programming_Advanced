<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Internal Sorts:</span> This method uses only the primary memory during sorting process. All data items are held in main memory and no secondary memory is required this sorting process. If all the data that is to be sorted can be accommodated at a time in memory is called internal sorting. There is a limitation for internal sorts; they can only process relatively small lists due to memory constraints e.g Selection Sort,Insertion Sort,Bubble Sort e.t.c<br></div><br>

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">External Sorts:</span> Sorting large amount of data requires external or secondary memory. This process uses external memory such as HDD, to store the data which is not fit into the main memory. So, primary memory holds the currently being sorted data only. All external sorts are based on process of merging. Different parts of data are sorted separately and merged together. e.g Merge Sort
