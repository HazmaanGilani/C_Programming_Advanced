<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Algorithm:</span>
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for accomplishing some task,each step has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finite ammount of time.<br>
Every algorithm should have the following characteristics:
<li>Input: The algorithm should take zero or more input.
<li>Output: The algorithm should produce one or more outputs.
<li>Definiteness: Each and every step of algorithm should be defined
   unambiguously.
<li>Effectively Computable: The computing agent can actually carry out the operation.
<li>Termination: An algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Method for Developing an Algorithm:</span>
<li> Define the problem you are trying to solve in clear and concise terms.
<li> List the inputs (information needed to solve the problem) and the outputs (what the
algorithm will produce as a result)
<li> Describe the steps needed to convert or manipulate the inputs to produce the outputs.
Start at a high level first, and keep refining the steps until they are effectively computable
operations.
<li> Test the algorithm: choose data sets and verify that your algorithm works.

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Complexity of an Algorithm:</span>
The complexity of an algorithm is the function f(n) which gives the running time and/or
storage space requirement of the algorithm in terms of the size 'n' of the input data.
The complexity function f(n) for certain cases
are:<br><br>
<span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Best Case :</span> The minimum possible value of f(n) is called the best case.<br><br>
<span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Average Case :</span> The expected value of f(n).<br><br>
<span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Worst Case :</span> The maximum value of f(n) for any key possible input.<br><br>

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Time Complexity:</span> The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it
needs to run to completion. Some of the reasons for studying time complexity
are:<br>
We may be interested to know in advance whether the program will provide
a satisfactory real time response.<br>
There may be several possible solutions with different time requirement.<br></div><br>

<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Space Complexity:</span> The space complexity of an algorithm is the amount of
memory it needs to run to completion. Some of the reasons to study space
complexity are: <br>
There may be several possible solutions with in different space requirement.<br>
To estimate the size of the largest problem that a program can solve.</div><br>
