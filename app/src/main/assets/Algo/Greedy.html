<span style="font-size:22px;color:violet;">Greedy:</span><br><br>
The Greedy approach constructs the solution through a sequence of steps. Each step is chosen such
that it is the best alternative among all feasible choices that are available. The choice of a step once
made cannot be changed in subsequent steps.
The choice of each step is a greedy approach is done based in the following:
<li> It must be feasible
<li> It must be locally optimal
<li> It must be unalterable<br><br>

<span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Steps required to develop  greedy algorithm:</span><br><br>

<li> Determine the optimal substructure of the problem.
<li> Develop a recursive solution.
<li> Prove that at any stage of recursion one of the optimal choices is greedy choice. Thus it is always safe to make greedy choice.
<li> Show that all but one of the sub problems induced by having made the greedy choice are empty.

<span style="font-size:22px;color:#226666;">Example:</span><br><br>
Suppose a greedy person has some 25p, 20p, 10p,
5paise coins. When someone asks him for some change then be wants to given the change with
minimum number of coins. Now, let someone requests for a change of top then he first selects 25p.
Then the remaining amount is 45p. Next, he selects the largest coin that is less than or equal to 45p i.e.
25p. The remaining 20p is paid by selecting a 20p coin. So the demand for top is paid by giving total 3
numbers of coins. This solution is an optimal solution. Now, let someone requests for a change of 40p
then the Greedy approach first selects 25p coin, then a 10p coin and finally a 5p coin. However, the
some could be paid with two 20p coins. So it is clear from this example that Greedy approach tries to
find the optimal solution by selecting the elements one by one that are locally optimal. But Greedy
method never gives the guarantee to find the optimal solution.</div></body>
