<body style="font-size:20px;font-family: ">C is a programming language developed at <b>Bell Laboratories </b>of USA in <b>1972</b>. It was designed and written by <b>Dennis Ritchie</b> ,mainly to rewrite the UNIX operating system in a portable way.
UNIX was written originally in assembler and had to be completely
rewritten for each new machine.The C language was based on previous
languages named B and BCPL.<br><br>

C is one of the most widely used third generation
programming languages. Its power and flexibility ensure it is still the leading choice for
almost all areas of application, especially in the software development environment.
Many applications are written in C, including the compilers for other
programming languages.<br><br>

C has many strengths, it is flexible and portable, it can produce fast, compact code, it
provides the programmer with objects to create and manipulate complex structures (e.g
classes in C++) and low level routines to control hardware (e.g input and output ports
and operating system interrupts). It has a virtue of High-level Programming Languages with efficiency of assembly Language.It supports modular and Structured Programming Concept.It is also one of the few languages to have an
international standard, ANSI C.<br><br>


In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee to provide a modern, comprehensive definition of C. The resulting definition, the ANSI standard, or "ANSI C", was completed late 1988.
