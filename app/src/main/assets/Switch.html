C has a multiple branch selection statements called switch. It tests the
value of an expression against a list of integer or character constants.
When a match is found the statements associated with that constants are
executed. The general format of switch is<br><br>
<pre style="line-height:100%;font-size:16px;font-family: monospace;
                background-color: #E0E0E0;
                padding: 15px;
                margin: 5px;
                border: solid;
                border-width: 1px;
                border-radius: 15px;
                box-shadow: inset 1px 1px 10px grey, 0 0 1px grey;white-space: -pre-wrap;
                white-space: -o-pre-wrap;
                word-wrap: break-word;
                white-space: pre-wrap;
                white-space: -moz-pre-wrap;">

Statement sequence<br>
}</pre><br><br>
Switch, case and default are key words and statement sequence can be
single statement or a compound statement. If it is compound statement it
must be enclosed in braces.<br><br>
The expression which is in switch, must evaluate to integer type. The
expression is switch can have int value or char value or expression
that evaluates to one of their constants. If character date type is used, its
equivalent integer value is considered. Floating point expressions are not
allowed in switch statement.<br><br>
In case expression such as case value1, case value2, case
value3, . etc the word value 1 is called case labels or case prefixes.
The case label can either be integer or character value. Each case label
must be distinct.<br><br>
When a switch statement is executed, the expression is evaluated and
control is directly transferred to the group of statements where case-label
value matches with the value of expression statements under that case
label is executed the break statement ensures immediate exit from the
switch statement. If none of the cases are satisfied, the default statement
is executed. The default statement is optional. If none of the case are
satisfied and default case is also not present, then no action takes place.
